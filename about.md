## About WebNotes

This site is a Web-based Notes. Thanks to Github, any change of the notes can be traced and be recover to the old version, unlike some noting tools, which could only save the latest update.

Using some Markdown and Git tricks, it is easy to get the Notes accessable anywhere.

## About Me

I have been working as a senior software engineer for more than 12 years. I am experienced in the areas of ARM/MIPS based SoC platforms, consumer electronics, datacenter based applications, telecommunications and wireless networking. I involved myself in many aspects of our products and projects for major domestic and foreign clients and I had been recognized with several awards during my career.

Until recently, I was working at HXT Semiconductor, a high-tech technology developer who focus on server solutions for the cloud computing and data center industries. I obtained new skills and knowledge in the application  department, where I had been involved in many projects including Machine Learning, Big Data, high performance computing, Web service, database and Cloud infrastrcture.

Before that, I worked at Broadcom, a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of digital and analog semiconductor solutions. In this role, I focused on BSP optimization, Device Drivers and Embedded system. Relevant experience includes designing, developing, unit test to make high-quality device drivers and applications for many different infotainment devices. Successful projects include those systems were integrated into some popular cars including Ford Mondeo, Suzuki Swift, Great Wall HAVEL H6 and BYD S6, which contributed to the gross profit of **$38 million** from the multimedia processor product line in 2015.

At the very beginning of my career, I started my job with software development on Windows CE. I composed Bluetooth applications and integrated with our own Bluetooth stack. The most projects were customized for OEMs, ODMs and end users. All of the products were tested for the compatibility with a great number of Bluetooth-capable cell phones.

Colleagues know me as a highly skillful developer who can always be trusted to come up with a new approach and to be quickly adaptable to new technologies and working with new equipment and platforms. I spend a lot of time understanding the business and the audience before suggesting ideas. I can (and often do) work well alone, but I am at my best collaborating with others.

I have a master’s degree in computer application technology and two issued patents.
