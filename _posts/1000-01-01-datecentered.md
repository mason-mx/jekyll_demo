> “I enjoy being part of DataCentred, working here is an achievement on its own, as being an Accounts Assistant I have learnt loads about the industry and I’m still learning. Everyone is great to work with and also helpful which is great for spirit levels and motivation which makes me happy and smile :)”

– Jash Patel, Assistant Accountant

> “DataCentred’s all about how far a person wants to go to succeed. I want to go as far as I can – otherwise I wouldn’t be here! This is a much better working environment than being on site – I do have deadlines to meet, of course, but it’s far better than being out in the field. I love the cycle to work scheme as well.”

– Mike Csullag, Electrical Engineer

> “From the interview stage, I knew that DataCentred was the right place for me. The culture of a company is so important and DataCentred has a great culture. I’ve been made really welcome. Everyone is working towards the same goal of making the business a success and that’s what makes working here so special.”

– Gareth Riley, Client Manager

> “Attracting the best people all comes down to the culture. I want to wake up in the morning and want to go to work. I have that here. I feel like I’m achieving something; it’s easy to stay motivated. And I leave work with a smile on my face every single day.”

– Simon Murray, Lead Cloud Systems Engineer
