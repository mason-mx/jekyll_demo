## Vehicle inspection

### What do I have to prepare before the annual inspection

* ID card
* Vehicle license
* **Driver's** license
* A hard copy of the mandatory vehicle insurance (with tax on the use of vehicles and vessels)
* The ID card of the agent, if he or she is on behalf
* Prepayment **of** RMB 300

### Where are the spots

Refer to the website of [Beijing Traffic Management Bureau](http://www.bjjtgl.gov.cn/jgj/95484/index.html), where **making a reservation is fairly flexible about** the date and spot.
