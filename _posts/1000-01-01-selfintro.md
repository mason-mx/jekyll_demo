## Sample Personal Introduction Speech

My name is Betty Smith and I turned 90 years old yesterday. I was born and raised in Washington, D.C. but moved here to Cardiff thirty years ago with my family. I have dedicated my life to helping others. For 35 years I was a professional nurse at the county hospital. I began my career as a nurse in the Second World War, and also assisted soldiers injured in Korea, Vietnam, and here at home. For the last decade, I have been a school nurse, and now I live with my son, his wife and their two children. It has been a beautiful life.

I settled on nursing because taking care of the soldiers seemed so natural to me. I met my husband on the battlefield. My children were born the year we ended the war and declared peace.  What else could I have done? This life of service found me.

One of the most interesting things has been meeting people in all the countries I’ve visited. In times of distress, you really see how tight each community becomes. If someone is in the water, they’re plucked out. If someone is injured, they’re bandaged. There are no questions, just action. I’d love to see that kind of community support all over the world. Not just during times of war and disaster, but in everyday life. The villages that support each other are the villages that succeed. In this giant village of Britain, it’s vital that we remember that our responsibilities lie not just with ourselves, but also with our neighbors. Our liberation is bound to the liberation of others.

I’d like to think I’ve done my part, been as useful as possible, and given to the best of my abilities. For now, I’d like to continue mentoring young nurses and enjoying my time with family and friends.

Giving a **self introduction speech** is something you have to do relatively often in most business and academic settings. Introducing yourself can be awkward enough in one-on-one situations... but having to introduce yourself to a group of strangers can be even more awkward and intimidating!

Unfortunately, in the business and academic worlds, these types of introductions happen all the time.

Many times a group of people will get together for the first time, and the leader of the meeting will ask everyone to give a short self-introductory speech.

These requests can catch you off guard if you're not prepared, and you only get one chance to make that all important 'first impression'.

But forewarned is forearmed - so make sure you spend time NOW preparing and practicing what you would say in these situations, ensuring your self-introduction speech puts you in the best possible light.

## Practicing and Preparing Your Self Introduction Speech

Thankfully, most speeches of this type are only around a minute long, at the most. You don't have to come up with lots of content or witty remarks.

The purpose of a self introduction speech is to make everyone present feel a bit more at ease and familiar with the people around them.

So make the most of your speech by sticking to the important facts.

During your self introduction speech, tell your listeners the following:

* Your name
* Your position
* Brief background information
* Interests, hobbies or passions
* A closing statement relevant to the meeting

If you can get all of those details put together in a brief introductory speech, you'll be golden! Remember, though, you are speaking simply to introduce yourself. Do not take the opportunity to brag, joke excessively or to register complaints!

The idea of this type of speech is not to give any individual the platform for personal gain or self promotion. Avoid any "Alpha Wolf" tendencies to make your introduction a competitive statement.

### Here is an example self introduction speech:

```
"Hello everyone.
My name is Jim Smith, and I'm a systems analyst.
I've been with the company for 5 years now. I started off as a technician and over the years progressed to my current role.
When I'm not working, I like to spend time with my son. We do a lot of fishing and camping together. My wife isn't a big fan, but she tags along with us most of the time.
```

It's good to be here and to meet you all in person. We all exchange emails and phone calls, but it's hard to really know someone until you've met face to face. I'm looking forward to talking about our upcoming project with all of you."

This is just an example, but it hits on all of the major points that you want to include in a self introduction speech.

Keep these kinds of brief speeches ready in your mind for these types of group gatherings. If you know you have one coming up, take some time to practice yours to be prepared before the meeting takes place.
