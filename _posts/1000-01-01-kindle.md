# How to read EPUB files on your Kindle

If you use an e-reader, it's probably a Kindle, which means it can be a pain to use open-source e-book formats like EPUB. Calibre is a free, open-source e-book manager that lets users convert EPUB files to Kindle-readable MOBI files. Here's how to use it:

* Download and install `Calibre`.

* When you first run it, Calibre will ask what language you want to use, and to select a folder to use as your e-book library. Next, select your primary reader.

* From the main screen, you can choose to add books by clicking the large icon in the top left. Add any EPUB files you've got that you want to convert.

* Select the EPUB files you want to convert and click `Convert books` in the top bar.

* Select your options. Calibre should have automatically decided on the MOBI format if you use a Kindle as your primary reader. You have a vast array of options to choose from, but for most EPUBs, you should find the basic setup good enough. When you're settled, click `OK` at the bottom right.

* It doesn't usually take very long, and once you've converted them, you can send them straight to your Kindle from within Calibre by selecting `Connect/share` from the top right or aiming your device at the correct folder.

Of course, you can use Calibre to convert other e-book files as well. It's a powerful program that can really help folks who have multiple readers or who want to explore new formats.
