## Linux OS

### top

* us - Time spent in user space
* sy - Time spent in kernel space
* ni - Time spent on low priority processes
* id - Time spent in idle operations
* wa - Time spent on waiting on IO peripherals (eg. disk)
* hi - Time spent handling hardware interrupt routines
* si - Time spent handling software interrupt routines
* st - Time in spent on involuntary waits by virtual cpu while hypervisor is servicing another processor (stolen from a virtual machine)

### Perf+MPI

Something like: `mpirun -np $NUMBER_OF_CORES ./myscript.sh` might work with myscript.sh containing:

```
/bin/bash
perf stat app_name %*
```

You should add some parameter to the perf call to produce differently named result files.
