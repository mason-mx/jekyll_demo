## Jekyll

### Jekyll installation

```
sudo apt-get -yqq install ruby ruby-dev make nodejs
sudo gem install --no-rdoc --no-ri jekyll
```

### Build and serve

```
sudo jekyll build /var/www/html
sudo jekyll serve -H "0.0.0.0" -P 4000
```

### Build and deploy by Docker

```
sudo docker run -ti -p 4000:4000 -v /hdd/web/jekyll/jekyll_demo:/data --name jekyll_demo --entrypoint "jekyll" james/jekyll:newest serve -H "0.0.0.0" -P 4000
sudo docker start -a -i jekyll_demo
```

### Responsive design

#### Media query

To fit various resolutions, we could arrange them in ascending order of min-width

```
@media (min-width: 768px){ //>=768 }
@media (min-width: 992px){ //>=992 }
@media (min-width: 1200){ //>=1200 }
```

or in descending order of max-width:

```
@media (max-width: 1199){ //<=1199 }
@media (max-width: 991px){ //<=991 }
@media (max-width: 767px){ //<=768 }
```

When the order is reverse, for example with min-width:

```
@media (min-width: 1200){ //>=1200 }
@media (min-width: 992px){ //>=992 }
@media (min-width: 768px){ //>=768 }
```

the first definition will be in vain when the screen width is 1440, which is more than 768 as well.

## Spring

## MySQL

To modify root password:

```
mysqladmin -u root password NEWPASSWORD
```

### Redis

#### Installation

Download, extract and compile Redis with:

```
$ wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-4.0.8.tar.gz
$ tar xzf redis-4.0.8.tar.gz
$ cd redis-4.0.8
$ make
```

The binaries that are now compiled are available in the src directory. Run Redis with:

```
$ src/redis-server
```

You can interact with Redis using the built-in client:

```
$ src/redis-cli
redis> set foo bar
OK
redis> get foo
"bar"
```

### Docker Mavan plugin

### Troubleshooting

#### JRE rather than JDK?

When we run into a failure as below, we could update your enviroment than try again.

```
No compiler is provided in this environment. Perhaps you are running on a JRE rather than a JDK?
```

On Windows, following steps could make Eclipse work well:

1. On your Eclipse IDE, go into Window > **Preferences** > **Java** > **Installed JREs** > and check your **installed JREs**. You should have an entry with a JDK there.

2. Select the Execution Env as show below. **Click OK**

3. Then **Right-Click** on your Project -> **Maven** -> **Update Project**

On Ubuntu, below commands could fix this issue:

```
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

#### Manage Docker as a non-root user

When we run into a failure as below, we could ran Docker without `sudo` permission to solve it.

The docker daemon binds to a Unix socket instead of a TCP port. By default that Unix socket is owned by the user root and other users can only access it using sudo. The docker daemon always runs as the root user.

If you donâ€™t want to use sudo when you use the docker command, create a Unix group called docker and add users to it. When the docker daemon starts, it makes the ownership of the Unix socket read/writable by the docker group.

* Add the docker group if it doesn't already exist:

```
sudo groupadd docker
```

* Add the connected user "$USER" to the docker group. Change the user name to match your preferred user if you do not want to use your current user:

```
sudo gpasswd -a $USER docker
```

* Either do a `newgrp docker` or log out/in to activate the changes to groups.

* You can use

```
docker run hello-world
```

to check if you can run docker without sudo.
